# Portfolio_Outsystems
A Technical Curriculum Vitae and Portfolio web application, designed for multiple profiles, CVs and configurations. 
(Work in Progress)

Example: http://cboom.outsystemscloud.com/Portfolio/

This application generates dynamic pages based on profile information in the database.
In the current version, the Outsystems 11 application makes use of an internal database (Microsoft SQL Server). Development for the application started January 2019.

In the next version, the application will be connected to an external (MySQL) database.

This repository contains an Outsystems Model Language export file (oml). The development side of the application is read-only and may be loaded for this purpose in a valid Outsystems 11 Service Studio environment. The end-user side of the application may be used.
